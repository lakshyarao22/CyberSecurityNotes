# Hacking Basics

## Threats

### Threat Maps

* [FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html)
* [CheckPoint](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/)
* [Other Threat Maps](https://www.google.com/search?q=threat+map)
  
**0day** :- Threats Unknown to OEM/Manufacturer Or Still do not have Patches.

**Doxing** :- releasing private info to public.

**Bot** :- Machines which is remotely controlled.

**Bot Net** :- Mesh of Bots.

## CIA Triad

**Confidentiality** :- Data not seen by unauthorized.

**Integrity** :- Data should not change.

**Accessibility** :- One who could Access should be able to access the data any time.

**Authencity** :- everything is as it should be and all members are agreed upon.

**Non-Repudation** :- if something is changed by someone then that person couldn't refuse the same

* (Repudation:- Denial of truth)

## Hacker's Motive:-

* Curiosity
* Bragging Rights
* Disruption of Businesses
* Hacktivism
* Political
* Terrorism
* Revenge
* Cyber Crime(Money)

## Hacker's job is to:-

Breach - Confidentiality

Disintegrate - Integrity

Reduce Accessibility

## Security Triangle

```

These 3 things should be balanced

**Attack Vector** :- The doorway to attack a system.

**Threat Actor** :- Creator of Threat.

**Threat** is something which has possibility of **exploit** against a **vulnerability**

### Threat Categories

### Network Threats

* MITM(Man In The Middle)
* DoS / DDoS
* DNS / ARP Poisoning
  
## Host Threats

* Password Cracking
* Malware
* Privilege Escalation
* Code Execution
  
## Application Threats

* Injection attacks
* Buffer Overflow
* Security Misconfigurations
  
**APT** :- Advanced Persistent Threats. Threats which are pre planned to attack and a organisation and are persistent i.e. being in organisation for a very long time.

## Types Of Attacks

### Passive Attack

* Gathering information passively. Not Actively Probing. Its not easy to detect. E.g. Sniffing the network.

### Active Attack

* Actively probing. E.g. Manupulation of data, Disruption of services, Compromising private systems or the network in large. It could be detected. E.g.
  * DDoS
  * Password Attacks
  * Session Hijacking
  * Impersonation
  * Lateral movement
  * SQL injection
  * RCE
  
### Close-in Attack

* getting sensetive info with physical proximity

### Insider Attack

* Someone with trust in organisation exploiting data or causing threats.
  * Pod slurping:- using a pocket device to steal data
  * Stealing devices

### Distribution Attacks

* Causing Harm to supply chain.
* Attack distribution system of vendor of target to disrupt business or install malware.

## Information Warfare

* Getting informational edge over competitor

### C2 Warfare

**Compromise** and take **Control** over opponents systems

### Intellegence Based warfare

Gathering more knowledge than opponents and also stop opponents in getting that information.

### Electronic Warfare

* Jamming the radio frequency or disrupt the communications

* Encryption

### Psycological

Mass misinformation spreading in order to spread terror or confusion.

### Hacker Warfare

* Theft Physical or electronic
* Dos

### Economic Warfare

* Getting edge over opponent by means of money.

### Cyber Warfare

Mimics information warfare

* **Symentac Attack**:- It is a takeover of a system where it appears normalicy is maintained.

### Simulated Warfare

Display of power or force.

### Stratges

* Offensive: attacking opponents.
* Defensive: Protecting ourselves.

## Types Of Security

### Defensive

### Offensive

* Annoyance e.g. Honeypots
* attribution e.g. Web Bug
* Attack

## Types of Hackers

* **Black Hat** :- use Knowledge for malicious intent
* **Grey Hat** :- use Knowledge for both malicious intent and good intent
* **White Hat** :- use Knowledge for good intent
* **Suicide Hackers** :- Who want to watch the system go down
* **Script Kiddies** :- Who do not have in-depth knowledge about computers and Hacking.
* **Cyber Terrorist** :- Who cause loss of Life
* **State Sponsored** :- Who protect country and its allies and attack enemy.
* **Hacktivists** :- It is the act of hacking, or breaking into a computer system, for politically or socially motivated purposes.
  
## Hacking Phases

1. [Recon](FootPrinting%20and%20Recon.md)
   * **Passive**
     * [Social Engineering][def]
   * **Active**
     * [Social Engineering][def]
2. Scanning
   * Find Ports and Services
   * Find Hosts
   * Find OS
   * Find Vulnerabilities
3. Gaining Access
   * Privilege escalation
<
   * SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution, Cross site scripting, etc.
   * Cracking passwords

4. Maintaining Access
   * Installing Malware and rootkits
5. Covering Up tracks
   * Modifying logs
   * Hiding malware

## [Cyber kill chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)

1. **Reconnaissance**:- Research, identification, and selection of targets.
2. **Weaponization**:- Pairing remote access malware with exploit into a deliverable payload (e.g., Adobe PDF and Microsoft Office files).
3. **Delivery**:- Transmission of weapon to target (e.g., via email attachments, websites, or USB drives).
4. **Exploitation**:- Once delivered, the weapon’s code is triggered, exploiting vulnerable applications or systems.
5. **Installation**:- The weapon installs a backdoor on a target’s system, allowing persistent access.
6. **Command and Control**:- Outside server communicates with the weapons providing “hands-on keyboard access” inside the target’s network(Pass the data back & forth by using reverse TCP).
7. **Action and Objective**:- The attacker works to achieve the objective of the intrusion, which can include exfiltration or destruction of data, or intrusion of another target

## TTP

* **Tactics**:- A guideline for how to proceed with something. E.g. Look for Vulnerabilities in a network.
* **Technique**:- Actual Action to be taken on set guideline. E.g. Use a vulnerability scanner.

* **Procedure**:- A more fine tuned version of Technique. E.g. use a vulnerability scanner to look for Web Vulnerabilities.
