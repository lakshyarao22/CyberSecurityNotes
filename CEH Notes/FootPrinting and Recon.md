## [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) And [Censys](https://search.censys.io/)

Shodan is used to find open ports vulnerabilities etc. on an IP or domain.

Similarly, we can use Censys to find hosts, IP Address, etc.

## Sub-Domain Enumeration

It is the practice of checking subdomains from list of common domains One-By-One.

``` text
        ____ Registered Domain
       v

  ^          ^
  |          |______Top-Level Domain
  |__Sub Domain
```
